Generics
	1. The Object is the superclass of all other classes and Object reference can refer to any object.
	   These feature lack type safety. Generics add that type of safety feature.
	2. Advantages of Generics:
		1. Type-Safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics.
		   It does not allow to store other objects.
		2. Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.
		3. Compile Time checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime.
	3. Types of Generics:
		1. Generic Class: Generic class is implemented like a non-generic class.
		   The only difference is that it contains a type parameter section.
		   There can be more than one type of parameter, separated by comma.
		2. Generic Method: Generic method takes a specific type of parameter and returns a some value after performing a task.
